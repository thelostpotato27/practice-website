    <div class="menacing intro">
        <p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh,
            where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department
            stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
            I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass
            of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no
            problems sleeping until morning.</p>
        <p> Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at
            my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm
            a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies,
            like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with
            society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't
            lose to anyone.</p>
